## About this port

Bugdom is a 1999 Macintosh game by Pangea Software. You play as Rollie McFly, a pill bug on a quest to save ladybugs from King Thoraxâ€™s iron grip on the Bugdom.

The game was bundled with some Mac models of the era. It is probably the most advanced game that uses QuickDraw 3D. Unfortunately, QuickDraw 3D has not been updated past Mac OS 9, so experiencing the game used to require booting a PowerPC Mac into OS 9 â€” until this port came out.

After I finished porting [Nanosaur](https://github.com/jorio/Nanosaur), Pangea offered to let me port Bugdom. I was excited to update this gem of a game because it was a childhood favorite of mine.

This port aims to provide the best way to experience Bugdom today. It introduces some modern comforts (such as support for arbitrary resolutions) and fixes some gameplay bugs. The overall experience is intended to be faithful to the spirit of the original game, so modifications to the gameâ€™s design are out of the scope of this project.

The first release of this port used a custom fork of [Quesa](https://github.com/jwwalker/Quesa) for rendering. Bugdom has switched to a tailor-made renderer as of version 1.3.1.

A port of the sequel is also available: [Bugdom 2](https://github.com/jorio/Bugdom2).
