# Bugdom Cheats & Secrets

## In main menu

Hold down `F10` and click on the START icon to bring up a level select dialog.

## In game

For most of these you need to hold down the tilde/backtick key (~ `) while pressing an F-number key.
The backtick key is just above Tab on a US keyboard layout.

| Key combo       | What it does                    |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| `F8`            | cycle debug modes               |
| backtick + `F1` | win this level                  |
| backtick + `F2` | get shield                      |
| backtick + `F3` | full health                     |
| backtick + `F4` | full ball timer                 |
| backtick + `F5` | full inventory                  |
| backtick + `F6` | toggle liquid invincibility     |
| backtick + `F7` | hurt player                     |
| `Alt` + `Enter` | toggle fullscreen/windowed mode |

Also, you can pause the game then press `<` or `>` to adjust the camera to prepare cool screenshots.

## During copyright screen

**While the copyright screen is shown after the game starts up**, you can trigger the following debug features:

- Hold down F2 and press Space to show the Save and Load screens.

- Hold down F3 and press Space to show the Lose and Win screens.

- Hold down F4 and press Space to show the Settings screen.

- Hold down a number key (1 2 3 ...8 9 0) and press Space to jump to the corresponding level

- Hold down F1 and press Space to bring up a model viewer.
  If you run this in windowed mode, information about the current model will be shown in the title bar. It's a bit clunky, but here are the controls:

  - [Tab] next model ([Shift-tab] previous model)
  - [Enter] next animation or object ([Shift-enter] previous anim or object),
  - [Space] toggle between skeletons and "display group" objects
  - [</>] swivel cam,
  - [z/shift-z] zoom in/out,
  - [g] toggle additive blending
